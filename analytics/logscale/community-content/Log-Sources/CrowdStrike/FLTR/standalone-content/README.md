These are individual dashboards, queries, alerts, etc for LogScale and FLTR. They are meant to be shared and imported ad-hoc, e.g. content from [Cool Query Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike). Have a dashboard or query you'd like to share? Then this is likely the place to submit the PR.

These are not meant to be a replacement for content in the official LogScale [Package Marketplace](https://library.humio.com/humio-server/packages-marketplace.html). However, feel free to use the content as necessary since they are meant to be learning examples.
