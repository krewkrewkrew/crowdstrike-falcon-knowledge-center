# 👨‍💻 Developer Journey: From SDK to Custom App

Welcome, developers! This guide provides a curated journey to help you get started with the CrowdStrike Falcon platform, from setting up your first SDK to building a custom security application. Our goal is to provide you with the tools and knowledge you need to build powerful, innovative solutions on top of the Falcon platform.

## 🗺️ Your Journey at a Glance

**SDK Setup → API Integration → Custom Application Development**

This journey is designed to be progressive, with each step building on the last. By the end, you will have a solid understanding of how to leverage the full power of the Falcon platform in your development projects.

## 📦 Step 1: SDK Setup

Your first step is to choose and set up the Falcon SDK for your preferred programming language. Our SDKs provide a convenient and intuitive way to interact with the Falcon API, abstracting away the complexities of authentication and HTTP requests.

### Recommended SDKs

| Language | SDK | Get Started |
|---|---|---|
| **Python** | FalconPy | [🐍 Getting Started with FalconPy](../../examples/python/getting-started-with-falconpy.md) |
| **Go** | goFalcon | [📖 Go SDK Documentation](../../sdks/golang/) |
| **PowerShell** | PSFalcon | [📖 PowerShell SDK Documentation](../../sdks/powershell/) |

Choose the SDK that best fits your project and follow the setup instructions to get it installed and configured.

## 🔗 Step 2: API Integration

Once you have your SDK set up, you can start integrating the Falcon API into your applications. The Falcon API provides a rich set of endpoints for interacting with every aspect of the platform, from managing hosts and detections to performing real-time response actions.

### Key API Capabilities

-   **[Device Management](../api-reference/openapi/):** Manage your hosts, groups, and policies.
-   **[Detection Management](../api-reference/openapi/):** Retrieve and manage security detections.
-   **[Real-Time Response (RTR)](../api-reference/openapi/):** Interact with hosts in real-time.
-   **[Threat Intelligence](../api-reference/openapi/):** Access CrowdStrike's comprehensive threat intelligence.

Start by exploring the **[API Reference](../api-reference/)** to see the full range of available endpoints and capabilities.

## 🏗️ Step 3: Custom Application Development

With a solid understanding of the Falcon API, you can now start building your own custom security applications. Whether you are creating a custom dashboard, automating a complex workflow, or building a new security tool, the Falcon platform provides the foundation you need.

### The Foundry Platform

For more advanced development, consider the **[Foundry Platform](../foundry/)**, CrowdStrike's application development platform. Foundry allows you to build, deploy, and share your own security applications within the Falcon ecosystem.

### Inspiration and Examples

-   **[Automation Scripts](../examples/automation/):** Get ideas for automating common security tasks.
-   **[Integration Patterns](../examples/integrations/):** Learn how to integrate Falcon with other tools and systems.
-   **[Community Tools](../tools/community-tools/):** See what other developers in the community have built.

## 🚀 What's Next?

Your journey as a Falcon developer is just beginning. We encourage you to continue exploring, building, and sharing your creations with the community. The possibilities are endless, and we can't wait to see what you build!
