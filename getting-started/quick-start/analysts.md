# 🕵️ Security Analyst Journey: From Threat Hunting to Incident Response

Welcome, security analysts! This guide provides a clear path to help you leverage the full power of the CrowdStrike Falcon platform for threat hunting, investigation, and incident response. Our goal is to equip you with the skills and knowledge you need to stay one step ahead of the adversary and protect your organization from modern threats.

## 🗺️ Your Journey at a Glance

**Threat Hunting → Investigation → Incident Response**

This journey will guide you from proactively hunting for threats to investigating and responding to security incidents, enabling you to reduce your mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR).

## 🏹 Step 1: Threat Hunting

Your journey begins with proactive threat hunting. The Falcon platform provides a rich set of tools and data to help you uncover hidden adversary activity and identify threats that may have bypassed your automated defenses.

### Key Threat Hunting Tools

| Tool | Get Started |
|---|---|
| **Falcon LogScale** | [🏹 Threat Hunting with LogScale](../../analytics/threat-hunting/threat-hunting-with-logscale.md) |
| **Investigate App** | [📖 Investigate App Guide](../../analytics/threat-hunting/investigating-with-the-investigate-app.md) |
| **MITRE ATT&CK® Framework** | [📖 MITRE ATT&CK® Integration](../../analytics/threat-hunting/mapping-to-mitre-attack.md) |

Start by learning the **[LogScale Query Language](../../analytics/logscale/)** and exploring the **[Threat Hunting Methodologies](../../analytics/threat-hunting/)** to build your hunting skills.

## 🔍 Step 2: Investigation

When a potential threat is identified, the next step is to investigate. The Falcon platform provides a wealth of contextual data to help you understand the full scope of an attack and make informed decisions.

### Key Investigation Capabilities

-   **[Process Timeline](../analytics/threat-hunting/analyzing-process-timelines.md):** Visualize the full execution chain of a process to understand its behavior.
-   **[Event Search](../analytics/threat-hunting/searching-for-events.md):** Search for specific events across all your endpoints to find related activity.
-   **[File and Network Analysis](../analytics/threat-hunting/analyzing-files-and-network-activity.md):** Analyze file and network activity to identify malicious artifacts and communications.

Dive into the **[Investigation Guides](../../analytics/threat-hunting/)** to learn how to use these capabilities to their full potential.

## ⚡️ Step 3: Incident Response

Once you have confirmed a threat, it's time to respond. The Falcon platform provides a range of response actions to help you contain the threat, remediate the damage, and restore your systems to a known good state.

### Key Response Actions

-   **[Device Containment](../examples/rtr/getting-started-with-rtr.md):** Isolate a compromised host from the network to prevent lateral movement.
-   **[Real-Time Response (RTR)](../examples/rtr/getting-started-with-rtr.md):** Remotely access and interact with a host to perform remediation actions.
-   **[Automated Response](../integrations/soar/):** Integrate with SOAR platforms to automate your incident response workflows.

Explore the **[Incident Response Guides](../integrations/soar/)** to learn how to build an effective and efficient incident response program.

## 🚀 What's Next?

As a security analyst, you are on the front lines of cyber defense. By mastering the threat hunting, investigation, and incident response capabilities of the CrowdStrike Falcon platform, you can become a more effective and efficient defender. Continue to hone your skills, share your knowledge, and work with the community to collectively raise the bar for cybersecurity.
