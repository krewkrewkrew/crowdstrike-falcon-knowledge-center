## Documentation Standards

### Writing Style

**Clarity and Accessibility**
Write documentation that is clear, concise, and accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise. Use active voice and present tense when possible. Avoid jargon unless it is clearly defined.

**Structure and Organization**
Follow the established directory structure and naming conventions. Each major section should include a README.md file that serves as both an introduction and navigation hub for that section.

**Code Examples**
All code examples should be tested and functional. Include necessary context such as prerequisites, dependencies, and expected outcomes. Use appropriate syntax highlighting and provide explanations for complex code segments.

### Formatting Guidelines

**Markdown Standards**
- Use consistent heading levels (# for main titles, ## for major sections, ### for subsections)
- Include table of contents for longer documents
- Use code blocks with appropriate language specification
- Include alt text for images and diagrams

**Link Management**
- Use relative links for internal documentation references
- Verify all external links are functional and appropriate
- Include link descriptions for accessibility
- Update navigation files when adding new content

**File Organization**
- Use descriptive file names with lowercase letters and hyphens
- Place files in appropriate directory structures
- Include README.md files in each major directory
- Maintain consistent file naming patterns

## Code Examples and Samples

### Quality Standards

**Functionality**
All code examples must be tested and functional. Include version information for dependencies and specify any required configuration or setup steps.

**Security**
Follow security best practices in all code examples. Never include real API keys, passwords, or other sensitive information. Use placeholder values and clearly indicate where users need to substitute their own credentials.

**Documentation**
Include comprehensive comments in code examples. Explain the purpose of each major section and any complex logic. Provide context about when and why someone would use the example.

### Testing Requirements

**Verification Process**
Test all code examples in appropriate environments before submitting. Include information about testing environments and any specific requirements or limitations.

**Error Handling**
Include appropriate error handling in code examples. Show users how to handle common error conditions and provide guidance on troubleshooting.

## Review Process

### Pull Request Guidelines

**Description Requirements**
Provide a clear and detailed description of your changes. Explain the problem you are solving or the improvement you are making. Include any relevant background information or context.

**Review Criteria**
Pull requests are reviewed for accuracy, clarity, completeness, and adherence to documentation standards. Reviews may include suggestions for improvements or requests for additional information.

**Feedback and Iteration**
Be prepared to address feedback and make revisions based on review comments. The review process is collaborative and aimed at ensuring the highest quality documentation for the community.

### Approval Process

**Review Timeline**
Most pull requests are reviewed within one week of submission. Complex changes or large additions may require additional review time.

**Merge Requirements**
Pull requests must receive approval from at least one maintainer before merging. All automated checks must pass, and any requested changes must be addressed.
